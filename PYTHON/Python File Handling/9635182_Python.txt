in1_ADID.txt  File
We are learning file input output operation in Python
Completed learning w.r.t command line arguments topic
CIS trainings going on well

f1.close


 2. Write a python script fileio2_ADID.py for the below mentioned requirements.
a. Use file in1_ADID.txt which was created in question1. 
b. Use the read() function to read the 11 characters from the beginning of file in1_ADID.txt and display read information on console.
c. Use the readline() function to read first line from file in1_ADID.txt and display read information on console. Any observation w.r.t output?
d. Use read() function to read the content of file in1_ADID.txt and display read information on console.

f1=open('in1_ADID.txt','r')
line=f1.read(11)
print (line)

line1=f1.readline()
print (line1)

line2=f1.read()
print (line2)



 3. Write a python script fileio3_ADID.py for the below mentioned requirements.
a. Use file in1_ADID.txt which was created in question1. 
b. Use the readlines() function to read line by line from file in1_ADID.txt and store result in list1_ADID. Display list1_ADID on console.
c. Display size of list,  list1_ADID on console.
d. Use close() function to close the file handler. Then read all the content of file using read() function. What will be the output?

f1=open('in1_ADID.txt','r')
list1_ADID = f1.readlines()
print (list1_ADID)
print(len(list1_ADID))
f1.close()
f2=open('in1_ADID.txt','r')
print(f2.read())


4. Write a python script fileio4_ADID.py for the below mentioned requirements.
a. Open the file, newfile1_ADID.txt from your current working directory in read mode. This file is not there in current working directory. What will the output? 
b. Open the file, newfile1_ADID.txt from your current working directory in write mode. This file is not there in current working directory. What will the output? 
c. Write string s1_ADID=“This is the newline added at end” to the newfile1_ADID.txt file. Display the content of newfile1_ADID.txt file on console. 
d. Again write, string s1_ADID=“This is the newline added at end” to the newfile1_ADID.txt file. Display the content of newfile1_ADID.txt file on console. Any observation w.r.t output?

f3.close()


5. Write a python script fileio5_ADID.py for the below mentioned requirements.
a. Use file in1_ADID.txt which was created in question1. 
b. Open the file in1_ADID.txt  in read mode as follows: 
fd1=open(“in1_ADID.txt”, “r”)
c. What will the output of fd1.name
d. What will the output of fd1.closed
e. What will the output of fd1.mode
f. Close the file using fd1.close(). Then find out the output of fd1.closed and display on console.

fd1=open('in1_ADID.txt','r')
print(fd1.name)
print(fd1.closed)
print(fd1.mode)
fd1.close()
print(fd1.closed())
