1. Find the highest, lowest, sum, and average salary of all employees.  Label the columns as Maximum, Minimum, Sum, and Average, respectively.  Run the query.

SELECT ROUND(MAX(salary),0) "Maximum",
 ROUND(MIN(salary),0) "Minimum",
 ROUND(SUM(salary),0) "Sum",
 ROUND(AVG(salary),0) "Average"
FROM employees; 

2. Modify the above query to display the minimum, maximum, sum, and average salary for each job type. 

SELECT job_id, ROUND(MAX(salary),0) "Maximum",
 ROUND(MIN(salary),0) "Minimum",
 ROUND(SUM(salary),0) "Sum",
 ROUND(AVG(salary),0) "Average"
FROM employees
GROUP BY job_id; 

3.Determine the number of managers without listing them. Label the column as Number of Managers.

SELECT job_id, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY job_id; 

4. Find the difference between the highest and lowest salaries. Label the column DIFFERENCE.

SELECT MAX(salary) - MIN(salary) DIFFERENCE
FROM employees; 

5.Create a report to display the manager number and the salary of the lowest-paid employee for that manager. Exclude anyone whose manager is not known. Exclude any groups where the minimum salary is $6,000 or less. Sort the output in descending order of salary.
SELECT manager_id, MIN(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY manager_id
HAVING MIN(salary) > 6000
ORDER BY MIN(salary) DESC;
