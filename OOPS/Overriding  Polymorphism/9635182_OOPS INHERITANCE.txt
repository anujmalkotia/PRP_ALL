Create  a base class Fruit with name ,taste and size as its attributes. 

Create a method called eat() which describes the name of the fruit and its taste. 

Inherit the same in 2 other classes Apple and Orange and override the eat() method to represent each fruit taste.

class fruit

{    

  protected char name, taste, size  ;

 scanner sc = new scanner ( system. in );

 

  public void eat ( ) 

 {

       scanner sc = new scanner ( system. in );

       system. out. println ( "enter the name of the fruit " ) ;

       name = nextChar ( ) ;

       system. out. println ( " please provide the taste of the fruit " ) ;

       taste = nextChar ( ) ;

       system. out. println ( " Name of the fruit is: " + name ) ;

       system. out. println ( " Taste of the fruit is: " + taste ) ;  

    }

}

class apple extends fruit

{

  void eat ( ) 

  {

       system. out. println ( " Name of the fruit is Apple " ) ;

       system. out. println ( " Taste of the fruit is sweet " ) ;

    }  

}

class orange extends fruit

{

   public void eat ( ) // overriding method

  {

       system. out. println ( " Name of the fruit is Orange " ) ;

       system. out. println ( " Taste of the fruit is sour " ) ;

    }

}

class main_class

{

 public static void main ( string args )

  {

    apple A = new apple ( ) ;

     A . eat ( ) ;

    orange O = new orange ( ) ;

    O . eat ( ) ;

  }

}

 Write a program to create a class named shape. It should contain 2 methods, draw() and erase() that prints “Drawing Shape” and “Erasing Shape” respectively.

For this class, create three sub classes, Circle, Triangle and Square and each class should override the parent class functions - draw () and erase (). 

The draw() method should print “Drawing Circle”, “Drawing Triangle” and “Drawing Square” respectively.
The erase() method should print “Erasing Circle”, “Erasing Triangle” and “Erasing Square” respectively.

Create objects of Circle, Triangle and Square in the following way and observe the polymorphic nature of the class by calling draw() and erase() method using each object.

Shape c=new Circle();
Shape t=new Triangle();
Shape s=new Square();

class Shape{
	void draw(){
		System.out.println("Drawing Shape");
		}
	void erase(){
		System.out.println("Erasing Shape");
		}
}
class Circle extends Shape{
	@Override
	void draw(){
		System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
	}
	void erase(){
		System.out.println("Erasing Circle");
	}
}
class Triangle extends Shape{
	@Override
	void draw(){
		System.out.println("Drawing Triangle");
	}
	void erase(){
		System.out.println("Erasing Triangle");
	}
}
class Square extends Shape{
	@Override
	void draw(){
		System.out.println("Drawing Square");
	}
	void erase(){
		System.out.println("Erasing Square");
	}
}

public class Polymorphism{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Shape c = new Circle();
		Shape t = new Triangle();
		Shape s = new Square();
		c.draw();
		c.erase();
		t.draw();
		t.erase();
		s.draw();
		s.erase();
	}
}
